Solving Existential Risks on Chain 

The 21st century is a turning point for humanity. In the last 100 years, we’ve seen the invention of many different technologies that have slingshot humanity leaps and bounds ahead of where we were just a few centuries prior.

With the invention of the modern personal computer, humans have access to more information, more content, and a degree of communication and collaboration that has never before been possible. 

As the saying goes though, with great power, comes great responsibility.

What is an Existential Risk?
An Existential Risk is anything that serves to be a hindrance or an outright cataclysm to the human condition. It could be as simple as an asteroid striking Earth and wiping us all out, a global food shortage leading to the stagnation of the human population, and with it, a plateau in human development, leading humanity to fade away slowly. These are all things that this writer feels are important that people in our generation that are alive today take note of, and begin working on ways to mitigate these risks where we can to ensure the prosperity of future humans.

Alongside the massive technological advancements we’ve made in the last few hundred years, we’ve also introduced a significant degree of self-imposed existential risks. Before the invention of things like nuclear weapons, space travel, advanced molecular science, large scale information distribution, humanity’s biggest existential risks were from external factors; Disease, Resource Shortage, and unavoidable astronomical catastrophes (asteroid impact).

In the last 200 years, humanity has done an excellent job of introducing new ways to either speed up any of these existing existential risks, but introducing a myriad of other unique and interesting ways we can blow ourselves into smithereens.

How Can Crypto-Economic Systems Help?
First, we should define what we mean when we say a “Crypto-Economic” system in this context; 

A “Crypto-Economic” system is a system in which anybody can contribute to a censorship resistant, decentralised and autonomous amalgamation of other actors. They serve to allow anyone the world over, regardless of stature, location, age, etc. to collaborate with other like minded individuals in a pseudonymous fashion. This is an immensely powerful tool for combating existential risks.

How many times have we wondered that the cure for a massively debilitating disease exists in the minds of a few select individuals, that throughout the course of their lives will never have the opportunity to actually see these cures come to fruition, or even have the ability to try? It’s probably happened several hundred times already. 

The Internet empowers all individuals to communicate, collaborate, and work toward these goals, but we don’t! Instead, we use the internet primarily as a form of entertainment and content consumption, and that’s because of two key missing pieces; incentives and trust.

This is where things get really interesting. There are two primary reasons that people have not chosen to use the Internet for these use cases; there was previously no way to really meaningfully be compensated for contributions in a censorship resistant manner, and an absence of a “trusted 3rd party”.

Welcome to Crypto my friends! All public blockchains truly boil down to incentive and trust machines. 

Smart contract platforms allow for the removal of a trusted third party, as the trust is baked into immutable, transparent, open-source software that exists on a public ledger that anyone may audit. Given the censorship resistance of cryptocurrencies, we also are able to solve the incentive problem. 

Currently, the use-cases being explored are finance-oriented. We’ve got big art projects coming up in the NFT with valuations of multiple millions of dollars, and trustless Decentralised Finance platforms handling billions upon billions of dollars in assets for users the world over. 

These two pieces are key in allowing humanity to collaborate, trust, and incentivise building a more sustainable world, and working toward solving existential risks, because if we fail, there will be no more Bored Apes… There will be nothing more of anything!

NFT Technology is very rapidly being used to develop reputation systems that allow people to effectively have a representation of their qualifications, accomplishments, and past contributions in an immutable fashion. This means that we could very well live in a world where you can quickly see a person’s entire career history, degrees, past projects in a way that doesn’t reveal their TRUE identity (and put them at risk) and is completely trustless.

A Very Basic Explanation of Quadratic Funding Mechanisms
Right now, public goods are usually funded by centralised governments. They take tax money from their citizens, and they deploy that capital to projects that elected officials decide upon. This worked a hundred years ago. It doesn’t work today. 

Quadratic funding/voting at a very high level, removes these intermediary government officials, and allows for a mechanism that has users select the preferred deployment of a basket of assets. GitCoin itself is a fantastic example of this model in action. If you’d like to read more about these mechanisms, click here.

Capital is allocated far more fairly in this model, as it allows for people to directly provide preference to what causes get funded, instead of having to trust in an elected official. It’s also far more efficient in allocating those funds to where there’s a genuine need, instead of just matching what has the most capital. 

This means that someone working to solve a resource crisis in a third world country has a far better chance of getting supplementary funding. 

So how does this help us solve existential risks? 
Knowing what we know about the above topics, we can quite quickly see how tools like GitCoin, or any other quadratic funding platform that aims to bring public goods development into the cryptosphere, as well as reputational NFTs will allow us to build legions of individuals committed to saving humanity.

We can also adequately fund these causes because Quadratic funding mechanisms don’t necessarily weigh the AMOUNT of capital allocated when considering how to supplement already donated capital, but instead they weigh the preferences and amount of individual actors who believe that this is the right way to allocate funds. So just because someone maybe only has a couple hundred dollars in Ether in their account, their vote/contribution has a meaningful impact, and as far as this writer is concerned, I think a lot of individuals should be rightfully concerned about preserving the future of humanity.
